## ADVANCED TROUBLESHOOTING

### Arc Blow in Detail

Arc blow is one of the most challenging welding problems and deserves special attention.

**Types of Arc Blow:**

1. **Forward Arc Blow**:
   - Arc deflects ahead of travel direction
   - Common when welding away from ground
   - Often at beginning of joints

2. **Backward Arc Blow**:
   - Arc deflects behind travel direction
   - Common when welding toward ground
   - Often at end of joints

3. **Side Arc Blow**:
   - Arc deflects to one side
   - Common in corners or near edges
   - Caused by unbalanced magnetic field

**Advanced Solutions:**

1. **Ground Placement Strategies**:
   - For backward blow: Move ground away from weld end
   - For forward blow: Move ground to starting side
   - Use multiple grounds for balanced field
   - Attach ground directly to workpiece, not fixture

2. **Current Adjustments**:
   - Reduce current to minimize magnetic field strength
   - Switch from DC to AC when possible
   - Try DCEN if using DCEP (if electrode allows)

3. **Arc Length Control**:
   - Shorten arc length significantly
   - Use drag technique to maintain control
   - Consider "digging" the electrode slightly

4. **Welding Sequence Modifications**:
   - Use backstep or skip welding technique
   - Weld from middle outward to ends
   - Change direction of welding
   - Break long welds into shorter segments

5. **Angle Compensation**:
   - Angle electrode against blow direction
   - Adjust work angle to compensate for deflection
   - Use side-to-side motion to counter side blow

6. **Specialized Techniques**:
   - Wrap welding lead around workpiece to create counter-magnetism
   - Demagnetize workpiece if possible
   - Use copper starting and run-off tabs

### Hydrogen Cracking Prevention

Hydrogen cracking (cold cracking) is a serious issue, particularly in high-strength and hardenable steels.

**Influencing Factors:**

1. **Hydrogen Sources**:
   - Moisture in electrode coating
   - Hydrocarbons (oil, grease)
   - Paint, rust, other contaminants
   - Atmospheric humidity

2. **Material Susceptibility**:
   - Carbon equivalent (CE) of steel
   - Hardenability of material
   - Thickness of material
   - Restraint level of joint

3. **Critical Temperature Range**:
   - Most hydrogen cracking occurs below 200°F (93°C)
   - May appear hours or days after welding
   - Often starts in HAZ then propagates

**Advanced Prevention Strategies:**

1. **Hydrogen Control Methods**:
   - Use low hydrogen electrodes (H4 or H8 designations)
   - Proper storage and handling of electrodes
   - Rebake according to manufacturer specifications
   - Clean joint faces thoroughly

2. **Thermal Management**:
   - Preheat based on carbon equivalent and thickness
   - Maintain minimum interpass temperature
   - Slow cooling rate through critical temperature range
   - Post-weld hydrogen release heat treatment (PWHT)

3. **Bead Placement Strategies**:
   - Temper bead technique for repair welds
   - Buffer layers with lower-strength electrodes
   - Proper bead sequence to temper previous passes

4. **Joint Design Considerations**:
   - Reduce restraint when possible
   - Use transition joints for dissimilar metals
   - Minimize stress concentrations

### Distortion Control

Welding distortion can cause significant problems in fit-up, appearance, and performance.

**Types of Distortion:**

1. **Longitudinal Shrinkage**:
   - Contraction along length of weld
   - Can cause warping or bowing

2. **Transverse Shrinkage**:
   - Contraction across width of weld
   - Pulls parts together

3. **Angular Distortion**:
   - Rotation around weld axis
   - Creates uneven surfaces

4. **Bowing/Buckling**:
   - Complex distortion of plates
   - Often wavelike deformation

**Advanced Control Methods:**

1. **Pre-Weld Techniques**:
   - Pre-setting (positioning parts at angle opposite expected distortion)
   - Pre-bending to compensate for expected movement
   - Pre-stressing with clamps or fixtures
   - Proper joint design to minimize weld volume

2. **During-Weld Strategies**:
   - Balanced welding sequence
   - Backstep welding technique
   - Skip or jump welding
   - Alternating sides of joint
   - Wandering sequence for multi-pass welds

3. **Heat Management**:
   - Controlled preheating to reduce temperature gradients
   - Spot cooling techniques
   - Heat sinks (copper bars, etc.)
   - Balanced heat input across structure

4. **Post-Weld Corrections**:
   - Mechanical straightening
   - Flame straightening
   - Controlled heating and cooling
   - Vibratory stress relief

## WORKPLACE TROUBLESHOOTING PROCESS

### Systematic Problem-Solving Approach

When faced with welding problems in a production environment, follow this systematic approach:

1. **Observe and Document**:
   - Note exact symptoms
   - Document when and where problems occur
   - Identify patterns or triggers
   - Take photos when possible

2. **Isolate Variables**:
   - Change only one parameter at a time
   - Test alternative materials, electrodes, or settings
   - Use process of elimination
   - Create test welds under controlled conditions

3. **Consult Resources**:
   - Review electrode manufacturer data
   - Check material specifications
   - Consult welding procedure specifications (WPS)
   - Review welding codes for requirements

4. **Implement Solutions**:
   - Start with simplest potential fix
   - Verify effectiveness with test welds
   - Document successful solutions
   - Update procedures to prevent recurrence

### Creating Test Coupons

Test coupons provide valuable information for diagnosing problems:

1. **Standard Test Plates**:
   - Use same material as production
   - Prepare identical joint configuration
   - Follow same welding procedure
   - Create multiple samples with varied parameters

2. **Testing Methods**:
   - Visual inspection
   - Bend testing
   - Break testing
   - Macro-etch analysis
   - Formal lab testing for critical applications

3. **Documentation**:
   - Record all parameters
   - Note visual observations
   - Document test results
   - Compare to acceptable standards
   - Photograph results

Effective troubleshooting requires understanding the complex interrelationships between equipment, technique, materials, and environment. By methodically isolating variables and making targeted adjustments, most stick welding problems can be solved.

Remember these key principles:
- Change only one variable at a time
- Document results and successful solutions
- Build a personal knowledge base of cause-effect relationships
- When in doubt, create test coupons to verify solutions
- Many problems have multiple contributing factors
- Prevention is always preferable to correction

Develop the habit of critically analyzing your welds and continually refining your technique. The ability to quickly identify and solve welding problems is what separates highly skilled welders from the average.
