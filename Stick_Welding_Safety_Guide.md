## ELECTRICAL SAFETY

Electric shock is one of the most serious and immediate hazards in welding.

### Understanding Electrical Hazards

![Electrical Hazard Diagram](https://via.placeholder.com/600x300)

#### Voltage Risks

## FIRE AND EXPLOSION PREVENTION

### Fire Triangle in Welding

![Fire Triangle](https://via.placeholder.com/400x400)

Welding operations provide all three elements needed for fire:
- **Heat/Ignition Source**: Arc, sparks, hot metal, slag
- **Fuel**: Flammable materials, liquids, gases
- **Oxygen**: Present in air, enriched in some environments

### Hazard Identification

#### Hot Work Danger Zones

| Material | Safe Distance |
|----------|---------------|
| Paper, wood, cloth | 35 feet (10.7m) |
| Flammable liquids | 50 feet (15.2m) |
| Explosive materials | 100+ feet (30.5m) |
| Confined spaces | Require special procedures |

#### High-Risk Areas
- Areas with combustible dust
- Locations with flammable vapor potential

#### Container Preparation Process
1. Empty completely
2. Disconnect from all pipelines
3. Clean thoroughly using appropriate methods
4. Purge with inert gas for severe hazards
5. Test atmosphere with combustible gas detector
6. Maintain ventilation during welding
7. Monitor continuously during procedure

### Fire Response Equipment
