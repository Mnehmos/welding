## Local Development

### Running Locally

To run this website locally:

1. Navigate to the project directory using your file explorer
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
3. Navigate through the site using the links

### Development Tools

For active development, consider using:

- A local server like [Live Server for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
- [Browser-sync](https://browsersync.io/) for multi-device testing
- Modern browser developer tools (F12 in most browsers)

## Making Changes

### CSS Modifications

- `styles.css` contains the main styling
- `responsive.css` contains media queries for different screen sizes
- The site uses CSS variables (custom properties) for consistent theming

### Adding Content

1. Follow the pattern of existing pages for new content
2. All pages should include the same header and footer
3. Add new page links to the navigation menu in all HTML files

### Adding Images

1. Add image files to the `images/` directory
2. Use responsive image techniques for better performance
3. Include appropriate alt text for accessibility

## Preparing for Production

Before deploying to a live server, consider:

1. Optimizing images with tools like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/)
2. Minifying CSS and JavaScript
3. Running accessibility checks with tools like [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/)
4. Testing across multiple browsers and devices
5. Implementing backend functionality for forms and interactive elements

## Future Development

Planned enhancements include:

- User accounts for saving progress
- Interactive practice tracking system
- Community forum for questions and discussions
- Video demonstrations of techniques
- Quiz and certification system
- Progressive Web App capabilities
