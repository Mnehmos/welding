   - Hero banners
   - Equipment examples
   - Step-by-step demonstrations

2. **Additional Diagrams**:
   - Weld symbols and their meanings
   - Welding positions (1G, 2G, 3G, 4G, etc.)
   - Electrode coating cross-section
   - More detailed equipment setup diagrams

3. **Animated SVGs**:
   - Arc formation and maintenance
   - Welding motion techniques
   - Proper body positioning

4. **Optimized Formats**:
   - SVG for vector graphics
   - WebP for photographs (with JPEG fallbacks)
   - Responsive image settings for different screen sizes

## Usage Guidelines

- All SVG images can be modified using any vector editing program (Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, etc.)
- Colors can be adjusted to match website theme by editing the gradient and fill definitions
- Text elements are editable for translation or terminology updates
- Maintain aspect ratios when resizing to prevent distortion
