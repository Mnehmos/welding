In a production version of this website, you would need to add the following images:

1. hero-welding.jpg - A high-quality banner image of stick welding in action (1200x500px)
2. welding-practice.jpg - Image for CTA section showing someone practicing welding (1200x400px)
3. page-header.jpg - Background image for page headers (1200x300px)
4. placeholder-stick-process.jpg - Diagram showing the stick welding process (800x400px)
5. placeholder-electrode-angles.jpg - Diagram showing proper electrode angles (600x300px)
6. placeholder-joint-types.jpg - Diagram of the five basic joint types (600x300px)

You can use the ASCII diagrams from the Stick_Welding_Visual_Reference.md file as a basis for creating these images. Professional diagrams would greatly enhance the visual appeal and educational value of the website.

For a fully functional website, you would also need to:
1. Complete all the content pages (techniques.html, electrodes.html, etc.)
2. Add real images throughout the site
3. Set up a proper backend for the newsletter and other interactive features
4. Configure proper hosting for deploying the site live
